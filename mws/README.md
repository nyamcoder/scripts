# About the weather scripts …


The purpose of _mito’s wx scripts (mws)_ is to display weather information in a minimalist yet stylish Linux desktop status bar.  As a light alternative written in _Bash_ and for _Dzen_, it would replace _conky_ or _conky-cli_, and the text-only tool _xmobar_.


There are currently are four of them, from low to high level:

* `mws.sh  ` — the most basic, comes with a small set of 20x20 px XPM icons

* `mws-f.sh` — alternative layout w/ °F (Fahrenheit) scale

* `mws-y.sh` — enhanced multi-line bar

* `mws-ycam.sh` — webcam widget for `mws-y.sh`


So far running with weather data provided by the services OpenWeatherMap, NWS/NOAA, and Yr.  Localizable GUI into _nearly any language!_ For details see the scripts’ comments, or the preview descriptions in my [deviantART gallery](http://mitoxd.deviantart.com/gallery/48968202/Scripting "mito's Scripting gallery").


Anyway it’s mandatory to get into grips with the _Dzen_ options and syntax!

Visit [its home](http://robm.github.io/dzen/) and consult [the readme](http://dzen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README) or [the wiki](https://github.com/robm/dzen/wiki/_pages).  Your GNU/Linux distro has probably also got an article about it.


The scripts’ license is [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/).  Feel free to match them your style, places, and language.  And most of all:

          Have fun!
